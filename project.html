        <h2>Boeing Outlier Detection Software</h2>
          <h5>Date: April, 2025</h5>
          <h4>Languages: C#, Python </h4>
          <h4>Frameworks: WPF, .Net, TensorFlow </h4>
          <h4>Tools: Git, Visual Studios </h4>
          <p>Repository: N/A<a href=""></a></p>

          <p>This software was developed as part of my capestone project and being a part of the Boeing Scholarship Program. 
            It was developed to identify anomalous data during wind tunnel testing using AI due to the restriction of the data 
            collection from the of the facilities.

          <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/redbeard691/NickS-Submission">Mimics</a></p>

          <p>This project was developed during a 24-hour WSU hackathon focused on the theme of internet privacy and safety. 
            Challenging myself to work solo, I created an AI that tracks and mimics a user's browsing behavior to mask their 
            true online activity. By the end of the event, I had a working proof of concept that was able to have multiple 
            copies of me and could go to different pages on the same website I was on. This project pushed my skills and highlighted 
            areas for future development and if I had more time would be able to flush out more features and make it a more complete project.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Animal Rescue Website</h2>
          <h5>Date: May, 2025</h5>
          <h4>Languages:  HTML, CSS, Javascript</h4>
          <h4>Frameworks: Node.js, Express.js</h4>
          <h4>Tools: Git, Visual Code</h4>
          <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/redbeard691/Animal-Shelter-Site">Rescue Site</a></p>

          <p>Developed a community-focused animal rescue website with Node.js and Express.js, enabling users to post notices 
            for lost and found pets. The platform allows for user profile creation, which includes a secure messaging system for 
            direct communication between individuals. In addition to the core pet-finding features, the site also provides articles 
            on animal care and has an administrative structure with distinct privileges for admins, shelters, and regular users, 
            allowing for content management and moderation.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Pirate Mayhem</h2>
          <h5>Date: April, 2025</h5>
          <h4>Languages: C# </h4>
          <h4>Frameworks: .Net, Monogame</h4>
          <h4>Tools: Git, Visual Studio</h4>
          <p>Repository: N/A<a href=""></a></p>

          <p>A 2D arcade-style game developed with the Monogame framework for a university-level game for a Software Design and Architecture class. As the captain of a lone pirate ship, players must strategically navigate chaotic battles against swarms of goblin-crewed ships, mythical krakens that hurl massive boulders, and enigmatic spaceships attempting to steal your gold.</p>
          <p>The core design challenge was to maintain performance under increasingly chaotic conditions. We focused on implementing design patterns to optimize efficiency, particularly as the number of on-screen objects, such as cannonballs and enemy projectiles, escalated. We specifically utilized patterns like singleton, Builder pattern and Command Patterns to manage bullet creation and destruction, significantly reducing the performance overhead of spawning new objects in real-time. This emphasis on optimized game architecture ensured a smooth and scalable gameplay experience.</p>

          <h4>Tools: Git, Visual Code</h4>
          <p>Repository: N/A<a href=""></a></p>

          <p>A desktop application built to provide a personalized news experience. The application uses a custom algorithm to process articles, determine their geographical origin, and visualize them on an interactive map based on user preferences. My role included implementing the software, creating foundational UML diagrams and other documentation, as well as coordinating with the team to ensure a cohesive development process.</p>

          <p>This application was developed to provide a powerful and user-friendly interface for exploring the large and complex Yelp Academic Dataset. The primary objective was to enable users to efficiently filter and analyze business information based on custom parameters, transforming raw data into actionable insights.</p>
          <p>The application allows users to query the massive dataset and retrieve specific business information based on their defined criteria. The custom filtering system can be configured by the user to return detailed results for businesses in a specified area, including critical information such as business type, hours of operation, and popularity metrics. This functionality is designed to simplify data exploration and provide a clear overview of the local business landscape.</p>

          <p>This project is a simple yet robust spreadsheet application designed to offer essential data management and calculation functionalities. The primary focus of the application is to provide a seamless user experience for basic data entry, while ensuring the integrity of all calculations through a dynamic update system.</p>
          <p>The application allows users to create, load, and save spreadsheet files, enabling them to easily manage their work. A key feature is the ability to highlight individual cells for organizational purposes. Most critically, the system is engineered to automatically and instantly re-calculate and update any cell affected by a change, ensuring all arithmetic operations are consistently and accurately reflected across the entire sheet. This dynamic updating process provides real-time feedback and maintains data consistency, making it a reliable tool for simple data analysis.</p>
