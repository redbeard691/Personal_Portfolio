                    <p>Growing up there was always an urge to build, whether it was with my Legos or building a wooden castle. I have about a decade's worth of work experience repairing, fabricating, and building various projects for customers. This has ranged from repairing personal projects for friends and CNC-machining prototype parts for a college rocket team to creating parts for the Department of Defense and other aerospace companies. I was even sent to Alaska to fabricate and build for companies in the fishing industry.</p>
                    <p>Due to medical reasons though, I was no longer able to physically keep up with the demands of these jobs and needed to make a career shift. Upon reflection, I realized I wanted to continue to build and repair things, but I needed a change in medium career wise. I wanted to try my hand with computers and software development.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Present</h2>
                    <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
                    <p>After making that decision, I immersed myself in the world of academia and pursued my Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. I've worked on projects using Haskell, C#, and Python for backend work, as well as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for frontend development. I've developed a wide range of software, from simple applications in Assembly to full-scale applications with AI as a supporting feature.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Future</h2>
                    <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
                    <p>I'm still learning so much, but the more I learn, the more I realize that our technology needs people who are willing to repair what is broken and build things to last rather than building for mass production.</p>
